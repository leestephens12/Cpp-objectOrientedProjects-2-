# Cpp-objectOrientedProjects-2-

In Excercise 1 of this project I used C++ objects to make client objects that has there bank account number, the amount in the account and their name.
From that point customers can choose if they want to withdraw or deposit money.

In Excercise 2 I created a die object that returns a random value. The user then plays
against the computer and whoever rolls the highest die wins.
